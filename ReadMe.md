This mini project is a Custom object tracker which starts by clicking on your desired object to track,
and then the particle filter tracks the object, using the visual features of the object which is precisely
the pixel color of the clicked point.

The configuration file contains the model's parameters for the video and for the 
parameters of the particle filter, so there's no need to touch the object's code
to change the behaviour of the filter.
